🎯 Objective:
Create a multi-agent system where agents self-plan, research, collaborate, and summarize information on a given technical topic — using tools (like Google Search APIs, file saving, embedding search). 

🧩 What They’ll Build:
At least 3 agents, each with different roles:

📚 Researcher Agent – uses search APIs or knowledge base to gather information

✍️ Writer Agent – drafts a technical document

🔎 Fact-Checker Agent – validates sources and findings

Agents should:

Use external tools (API calls, file system, embedding-based memory like FAISS)

Work autonomously after user gives a single goal

Handle error recovery: e.g., if research fails, retry or switch methods

💡 Example Use Case:
User inputs:

“Prepare a 2-page summary on the newest LLM optimization techniques.”

Then:

Researcher fetches online data / internal documents

Writer organizes info into sections

Fact-Checker verifies claims

Writer refines final document based on feedback

→ Final Output: A polished, verified technical report generated almost autonomously!

Bonus:
Adding a 🧠 Memory Manager Agent – stores important findings into a memory DB
Use a memory store: recall previous facts to avoid redundant research
Memory Manager stores relevant pieces
